--How to build NoLifeStory on linux--

You will need:

- g++ > 4.6 (for C++0x support)
- A recent version of SFML 2 and all its dependencies
- zlib

go to the ./build/linux directory
and run make

For cleaning up, run make clean

For rebuilding, run make clean && make (DURR)

If you want to build the 64 bit version (with 64 bit libbass), 
run make NLS64
