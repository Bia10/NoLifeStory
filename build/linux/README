--How to build NoLifeStory on linux--

You will need:

- gcc > 4.6.1 (for adequate C++0x support)
	A lower version may do the job, but if it phails, don't blame me
- Most recent sfml2 version
	https://github.com/LaurentGomila/SFML/tarball/master
- zlib
	http://zlib.net/ or check your distribution if it supplies the package

To actually build the thing:

go to build/linux and run make

Oh, and if you are building on a 32 bit system, replace lib/libbass64.so with lib/libbass.so
in the Makefile

kthxbye
